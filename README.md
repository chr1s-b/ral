## Work experience @ STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell

### Some demo output from real data
![](demooutput2.png)

#### Data sourced from https://gist.githubusercontent.com/StewMH/9f75f8c2915e33b4248ed994173ebc53/raw/03a4f4221a424167beb824ad902768c900a08c50/event through Kaggle. The data is currently stored locally in the repo, allowing the code to run offline without pulling the data from the Gist.

## So what does it actually do?
#### This program takes many points from a particle detector around a collision (like that of the ATLAS detector) and aims to trace viable paths between points to reconstruct what particles were produced in the collision. The program does not predict the particles produced, but it plots the possible paths of particles.
